## System Assumptions and Simplifications

### Core Assumptions

1. **Grid-based World**: City represented as 100x100 grid with integer coordinates
2. **Discrete Time**: Time advances in discrete ticks rather than continuous
3. **Fixed Movement Speed**: All drivers move at identical speed (1 unit per tick)
4. **Manhattan Distance**: Movement and distance calculation use Manhattan distance
5. **No Traffic**: No traffic congestion or road conditions affecting movement
6. **Perfect Information**: System has complete knowledge of all entities' positions
7. **Immediate Communication**: No network delays in driver-rider communication

### Simplifications Made

1. **Binary Driver Load**: Driver load simplified to 0 or 1 (assigned/not assigned)
2. **No Driver Preferences**: Drivers don't have personal preferences or ratings
3. **No Rider Preferences**: Riders don't specify driver preferences
4. **No Dynamic Pricing**: Fixed pricing model (not implemented)
5. **No Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket for real-time position updates
6. **No Persistence**: All data stored in memory, no database
7. **No Authentication**: No user authentication or authorization
8. **No Rate Limiting**: No API rate limiting or throttling
9. **No Geographic Constraints**: No real-world geographic boundaries
10. **No Weather Conditions**: No weather affecting movement or availability

### Technical Simplifications

## Data Models

### Driver

- `id`: Driver ID (auto-generated)
- `x`, `y`: Current position coordinates
- `status`: Status (available/on_trip/offline)
- `assigned_request_id`: Assigned request ID

### Rider

- `id`: Rider ID (auto-generated)
- `pickup_x`, `pickup_y`: Pickup point coordinates
- `dropoff_x`, `dropoff_y`: Dropoff point coordinates

### RideRequest

- `status`: Status (waiting/assigned/rejected/completed/failed)
- `attempts`: Attempt count
- `assigned_driver_id`: Assigned driver ID

## Dispatch Algorithm Design

### Core Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to assign drivers to requests:

```
score = Î± Ã— ETA_to_pickup + Î² Ã— num_assigned
```

Where:

- `ETA_to_pickup`: Manhattan distance from driver to pickup point
- `num_assigned`: Number of requests assigned to driver (simplified as 0 or 1)
- `Î±`, `Î²`: Weight parameters (configurable via environment variables)

Drivers with lower scores have higher priority.

### Algorithm Goals

1. **Minimize ETA**: Prioritize drivers with shortest estimated time to pickup
2. **Fairness**: Distribute requests evenly among drivers through load balancing
3. **Efficiency**: Maximize completed rides and minimize idle drivers
4. **Fallback**: Retry with alternate drivers upon rejection

### Implementation Details

- **Distance Calculation**: Uses Manhattan distance for simplicity and grid-based movement
- **Load Balancing**: Considers driver's current assignment count in scoring
- **Rejection Handling**: Simulates driver rejection with configurable probability
- **Retry Logic**: Attempts assignment with next best driver if current driver rejects
- **Concurrency Safety**: Uses thread locks to prevent data races in multi-request scenarios

### Algorithm Assumptions

1. **Fixed Speed**: All drivers move at the same speed (1 unit per tick)
2. **Manhattan Distance**: Movement follows grid lines, not diagonal paths
3. **Immediate Assignment**: Drivers are assigned immediately when available
4. **No Preemption**: Once assigned, drivers complete their current trip
5. **Simplified Load**: Driver load is binary (assigned or not assigned)

## Time Progression Mechanism

Each time the `/tick` interface is called:

1. Iterate through all drivers with `on_trip` status
2. If driver hasn't reached pickup point, move one step towards pickup point
3. If driver has reached pickup point but not destination, move one step towards destination
4. When driver reaches destination, mark request as completed, reset driver status to available

## Concurrency Safety

The system supports multi-threaded environments:

- Uses `threading.Lock` to protect critical data operations
- Can control whether to enable locks via `ENABLE_THREADING_LOCK` environment variable
- All write operations (create, update, delete, dispatch, time progression, manual accept/reject) are protected by locks
- Thread locks ensure data consistency in concurrent environments

## Configuration Parameters

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name           | Default | Description                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `DISPATCH_ALPHA`        | 1.0     | Distance weight in dispatch algorithm       |
| `DISPATCH_BETA`         | 0.1     | Load weight in dispatch algorithm           |
| `REJECTION_RATE`        | 0.1     | Driver rejection probability                |
| `MOVE_SPEED`            | 1.0     | Distance moved per tick                     |
| `HOST`                  | 0.0.0.0 | Server listening address                    |
| `PORT`                  | 8000    | Server listening port                       |
| `ENABLE_THREADING_LOCK` | true    | Whether to enable threading lock for safety |

### Effect on Dispatch Behavior

- **DISPATCH_ALPHA**: Controls how much distance to pickup point affects driver selection. Higher values prioritize closer drivers.
- **DISPATCH_BETA**: Controls how much driver load affects selection. Higher values prioritize less busy drivers.
- **REJECTION_RATE**: Probability that a driver will reject an assignment (0.0 to 1.0).
- **MOVE_SPEED**: How far drivers move each tick when traveling to pickup/dropoff points.
- **ENABLE_THREADING_LOCK**: When true, uses thread locks to prevent data races in concurrent environments.
